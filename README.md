# News App

This is a simple Flutter project that demonstrates how to build a news app using key concepts:

## Key Learnings

### 1. Async/Await
Learn how to fetch data asynchronously so your app stays responsive while waiting for network operations. Async/await makes it easy to write readable asynchronous code in Dart.

### 2. API Handling
See how to connect your app to a real-world news API, send HTTP requests, and process JSON responses. This is essential for apps that need live data from the internet.

### 3. Exception Handling
Robust error handling ensures your app can gracefully handle network errors, timeouts, and unexpected data formats. This improves user experience and app reliability.

## Why These Matter in Real-World Apps
- **Async/await** keeps your app smooth and prevents freezing during slow operations.
- **API handling** lets your app interact with external services, making it dynamic and useful.
- **Exception handling** protects your app from crashes and helps you show helpful error messages to users.

## Getting Started
To run this app:
1. Install Flutter: [Flutter Install Guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
2. Run `flutter pub get` to fetch dependencies.
3. Use `flutter run` to launch the app on your device or emulator.
